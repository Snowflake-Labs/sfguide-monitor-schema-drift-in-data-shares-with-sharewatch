# Monitor Schema Drift in Data Shares with Sharewatch

## Overview
ShareWatch is a Streamlit-based application installed on consumers of data share's Snowflake accounts to detect schema drifts in data shares received by these consumers.  ShareWatch triggers notifications based on schema drift detection, which is part of Snowflake's [best practices to operationalize shares](https://www.snowflake.com/en/resources/white-paper/data-sharing-best-practices-managing-schema-drift-and-data-change-with-shared-data/), and integrates them in mission-critical data pipelines. The app provides a starting point and can be extended to implemenet other best practices discussed in the whitepaper.
